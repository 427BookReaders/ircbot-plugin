       Allows you to change the rate at which the bot will broadcast messages to IRC.

       You should usually <font color="red">NEVER</font> change this setting, it will normally result in getting
       your bot banned from the IRC network!

       The rate is given in milliseconds.

       (It's only useful for those who is running the bot towards a private network where
        it is allowed to bypass message throttling and won't get killed/banned by the IRC daemon)
